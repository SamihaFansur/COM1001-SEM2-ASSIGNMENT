              Everyone using this website should be able to easily navigate to the desired information, read and understand what is written. 
          </p>
          <p>
              As the website is designed to be of a light colour scheme, I have made sure that there is good contrast between the 
              background, background images, pictures and text to improve readability. The font is of a dark colour in order to not hurt 
              usersâ€™ eyes as well as making it easier to read. Consequently, the text is appropriately sized in terms of both the overall 
              size and the type of text it is i.e. Headings are larger than sub-headings which are larger than the content. Additionally,
              hyperlink texts stand out from the body text so that user can differentiate between them.
          </p>
          <p>
              Furthermore, images have an alt text provided. Images are appropriately sized and sufficiently used to make the page look 
              more attractive and keeping the users attention. JPG images are used in order to decrease loading time.
          </p>
          <p>
              This website can be used on devices with various screen widths. Keeping this aspect in mind, buttons have appropriate margins 
              and padding to prevent user mistakenly clicking the wrong button, as well as preventing buttons from overlapping. You can 
              use a keyboard to scroll through the pages.
          </p>
          <p>
              There is always room for improvement so if you still feel that there is something to improve please

              and I will respond to your query within 2 working days.
